bishop of Lyons by, the chapter which thought thus to strengthen
the Emperor's cause in France.¹ But he never entered the office.
As archbishop 81 Sens and, after 1178, archbishop of Reims‚ papal
legate and cardinal, he rendered conspicuous service to his time.
. His official relations (records of which in the form of letters and
charters are extant) with Thomas Becket, Pope Alexander III,
Louis VII, his brother-in-law, and Philip Augustus are well
known. He asserted ecclesiastical control in and about Sens,
vesting the oversight of the 18188111881188 in his precentor.2 He
fostered trade and learning, promoted the growth of the communes

in a way that served other towns as a model.3 But the chroniclers ι·

say he was 'ambitious and that not content with anointing Philip
Augustus in 1179 at ReimS, he begrudged his successor Guy,
archhishop of Sens, the honor of crownin'g him at Paris in 1180.
At his solicitation‚ it is said, the Pope confirmed to the archbishop
of Reims the right to thus enthrone the King of France.

attention to Sens. Here from October 30, 1163, until Easter,
1165, Ρ888 Alexander III resided, 18818 expensis 8118188188, forced
by the Emperor to seek refuge in France. About a year later the ·
exiled and fugitive Primate of England, Thomas Becket, began his
long stay at the monastery of St. Columba, whose shelter he left
only a few months before returning to his post of danger and death.

of Salisbury,a fellowexile but a gentler spirit, the letter advising

st. Gregory instead of canon law and scholastic philosophy.4

ι The king of France was often seen and his power was felt in
Sens. Louis VI in 1121, speaking 88 “the eldest 888 of the

1Η88τί Ι, 88881 of Champagne, his older brother, was 81 the time wavering between
Pope Alexander III aud the Emperor. The latter's candidate for the papacy‚ or the
anti-pope Octavian, was besides a kinsman of Henri. See D’Arbois‚ Histoire, 111,
