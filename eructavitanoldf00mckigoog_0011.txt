6 ΤΗΕ ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENGH POEM.

It is reasonable to assume that library economy so pious and
strenuous as that of Arnaldus¹ was effective in preserving and
enlarging the monastery’s store of books. If so, those listed in
1123 by Clarius, and others beside were accessible to our writer
when, some fifty years later, he sought material 01 which to weave
his poem.

In the collection listed in 1123, next to the various books of the
Bible (which are given in the order required 101 reading during
the year), the works of Gregory the Great are most prominent. In
fact there was a complete set 01 his expository writingS, excepting
only the Homilies on Ezekiel and the latter half of the Moraliu in
Job. The three works now regarded as spurious are not mentioned.
Probably the missing works are more than compensated 101 by the
work which Clarius numbers V111, to which the simple title Putcriua ἵ
is given. This must have been the compilation by Paterius, disciple
of Gregory the Great, of the latter’s Bible quotations and comments
thereon, usually called the Liber Testimoniorum. Only one work 01
Augustino is in the list, the Tractutua iu &patulum ι1011001110. It
is the third of the collection, and is mentioned among the volumes Α
01 Scripture. In the fourth volume mention is begun 01 Gregory's
works,

There is no record 01 fire again destroying the abbey of St. Pierrc-
le-Vif within the period that especially concerns us. In 1147, to

be sure, the abbot Herbertus (altho with TheobalduS, abbot 01 St. . .

Columba, he had enlisted 101 Louis VII's crusade) was killed by an

uprising of townspeople. His successor, Gerardus, introduced the
Cluny regulationS, probably insuring better discipline during his
rule, which ended in 1167 by resignation. In his time and in the
next twenty years occur events which must have brought to the
knowledge, and even before the eyeS, of our poet some of the
greatest personages 01 the time: the King 01 France, the Count 01

¹The words 01 Clarius make it plain that the rules 01 Arnaldus were really
eniorced: Excommunicavit enim omues indifferenter qui aliquem vel aliquos
suscriptorum librorum, vel venderent, vel accommodarent, vel aliquo modo efficerent,
quo ecclesia perderet, et librum nou rehaberet. Ipse enim Deo optulit, etqua
custodia potuit munivit. Duru's work, cited above, Obrue. obiti, anno 1123. ι
