delighted. He determines to sing of the Queen's sonS, oomfort-

of paradise, noble martyre, holy apostles. Like the pains of her

who bears a child are your sorrows at their sufferingS, when they
despised this world.'' ¹Ll. 1905-1968.

God has delivered them from destruction. Praise will betheir
employment. Boundless knowledge, untrammeled power of motion,
