THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENOH ΡΟΕΜ. 33

emittuntur Apostoli, vel divina Li apostre qui Deu oirent
praeconia jaculantur. Etsi diciple qui le virent
Sont les saietes qu'il anvoie.

A supplement, as it were, to the above occurs in Augustine's
Semne 298, parag. 2. It ends as quoted below, and may be compared
with ll. 726-733 of the poem: k

Quibus sagittis factum est quod Mout est soes et douz cist fers
sequitur, Populi acb te eadent. Qui si perce le cuer del vantre
Bona sunt talia vulnera. Vulnus Que nus ne set quant il i antre.
amoris salubre est. Buer est nez cui cil fers ataint:
C'est li cos don nus ne se plaint.

Gregory the Great„ as already stated, nowhere expounds Ps. XLIV
as a whole. ln various passages, however, of his expository works ,
and his homilies he commenta upon the King's bow and arrows as the
Scriptures applied in preaohing. He differs from Augustine, whose
authority had no doubt made the figure well known, in dwelling upon
it at greater length and in not expressly saying, but only implying
that the arrows signify the Apostles and the preachers of the
Gospel as wellas their messages. He agrees with Augustine in the
allegory of the bow and the cord: the severity of the Old Testamenta
bent and mitigated bylhe grace of the New. The passage istoc
long to quote¹ ’ ’

As stated above, we may safely conclude that the book so briefly
mentioned by Clarius (Hinc sequitur Paleriae im VIII columine) was
the well known Liber Testimoniorum of Gregory's secretary, Paterius 3
and that it served our poet, according to the long prevalent custom,
as a ready manual of reference for Gregory's commenta on the books
of the Bible in order.

With the aid of Paterius the poet probably found the alleged
passagc² from Gregory' s Hamil. IX in Ezechielem. Or Paterius may

¹1tis found in the Moralic io Job, xlx. See Migne, LXXVI, 133, 134.

¹The term alleged is here used because, as the editor acknowledges in a loct-note
(Migne, LXXIX, 866), the passage cannot be identified in Migne's text of the homily
itself which Paterius claims to quote from.
