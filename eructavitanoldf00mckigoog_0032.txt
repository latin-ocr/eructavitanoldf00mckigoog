THE ERUOTA VIT, ΑΝ OLD FRENOH POEM. 27

altho the heading contains it in all the complete copies and most
of the commentators explain it. In l. 157 8 an anachronismis
committed. Here David is made to quote J eremiah, mentioning him
byname, contrary to the poet' s custom.

Α This part of my study was begun with the theory that the

’ Ihoctovit is a translation of some extended comment on Psalm XL1V;

that the poet's task was, as he says, ll. 15-20,139-144, to turn
Latin into Romanae verse. Searoh was therefore ‘made for an
original among the earlier commentatore.

'The most important expositions of Psalm XLIV, written before
our poet's time, are those of Augustine, J erome, Cassiodorus, the
Venerable Beda, Haymo of Halberstadt, Radbertus Paschasius,
Brimo of Wiirzburg, Bruno of Korn or perhaps of Monte Cassino, ’
and Peter Lombard. These and many other authors of devout
works were consulted ,by me, but nothing like systematic translation
or paraphrase was found vto have been made from them. Passages
here and there were identified, but to no great extent.

The first long passage of the Eructavit that Ι was able with
confidence to refer to arr earlier writer was that on the King' s arrows,
ll. 663-8683 and this not to any of the comments on Psalm XLIV,
but to Gregory the Great'e Moraliu ia Job, XIX and XXXIV. For
nowhere does this writer effera general exposition of the psalm in
question. It became plain on further search that Gregory, as· usual
modifying and extending the ideas of Augustine, must be called our
poet's master rather than any other single writer. Yet there is no
continuity of imitation, no systematic borrowing even here.

I abandoned therefore the theory entertained at the stnrt, becoming
convinced that the poet's claim, in ll. 15-20, 139-144, to be a mere
translator into verse is a matter of literary convention, intended
