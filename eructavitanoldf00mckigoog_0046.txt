THE ER UOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH POEM. 41

may be 'referred the allusion to Longinus and his spear-thurst, ll.
maa-1259. Philippe's Bosttot're, ll. aaa-305, contains a statement,

upon Augustine's authority, conoerning Saturday as the final day of
reward for the faithful. The Eructomt, ll. 1824, 1825, thus begins
to speak of the resurrection of the just:

¹ A cel haut jor de samedi
Sera por voir si com jc di ’. . . .

. In two passages upon the incarnation, ll. 87-134, lala-1660,-
both developed from Luke 1, 35,-are reflected the arguments of
J erome's Contra Helvidium, of Ambrosc's hymn, Veat', redemptor
pontiam ; of Isidore's De orto et obita ‘patrum of Radbertus
Paschasius in his De Portu Virpt'rtt's. The latter author, it must be
remembered, wrote also the longest exposition of Psalm XLIV, as has
already been stated. He was a Benedictine, and wrote both
’ productions sor devout women living as cenobites. The controversy
of our poet's generation upon the person of the Virgin Mary must
have brought again into notice his writings aud others of like nature.¹
A popular explanation of an unspeakable mystery is perhaps to be ,
recognized in ll. lla-120: , r

A la voiz que li anges dist-¹

The poet shows familiarity with the current literary usages of his
time, as I have shown; his style shows, further, that he employs the

current phraseology of the poeta. Even the compositions in which ’

love is the theme are not unknown to him, as the following passage
proves, ll. ttae-1450, where David exhorts the Queen concerning
her wifely duties ε

lThe same idea appears in the ancient hymn beginning: Are, virgo, motor matti,
Qut ptr aurern concepisti, Gabriele acacio; and in a very much later and different
composition, Moliere's L'Ecole des Femmes, v, t‚-Arn01phe’s words to Agnes. For
the Latin quotation in this reference I am indebted to Professor F. De Haan, Bryn
Mawr, Pa.
