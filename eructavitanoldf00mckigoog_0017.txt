12 THE ER Hora ΠΤ, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

by accident, at Acre, September 10, 1197, six months before his
mother died at Meaux. His official position, as titular King 01
Jerusalem, rendered his death a serious loss to the Christian 00000
’ 10 110 Εο01. Ρο00 10000001 III, 'altho regarding Henri as 00
010110000 001 110 tragic end as a divine judgment, wrote to the
archbishops of Reims and Sens, and to the bishop of M‘eaux,
urging that comfort and protection be extended to Marie. She
died without receiving either,l and without seeing the 000001011οο
01 110 devout poem, 10 Genese, which Evrat was preparing for her.
Probably she never saw the Eructavit, if it was ,begun after the
death of Henri Π. Βο1 there is strong probability, I think, 01
00 earlier 1010. ὁ

For the passage containing an apparent reference 10 100 bereave-
, ment, ll. raro-1960, finds sufficient motive in the death of Henri Ι,
100 husband, in 1181. Ηο 100 was really a victim of the crusade,— ¹
his family connection furnished many,²-and therefore, according
’ 10 0000001 0010100, 10 000 0 martyr of the faith. The poet's
opportunity then was, most probably, this bereavement, which came
only about a year after the death of her father, King Louis VII.
Even at an earlier date Marie,perhapS, 101 shown inclination for
a more devout 1110.3 The cares 01 ¹administration and repeated
negociatione for the marriages of her⁸ children were among her
burdens even before the death of Henri Ι. The outlay caused by
his last crusade, involving probably his ransom from captivity, will
explain 110 poet's expression, in ll. 3-14, 01 0011011010 1001 10 001 ,
011000 suffer in consequence 01 100 generous expenditure.

This passage, already quoted 00 p. 2, is probably more than a

ι10 100 1001 days she was without the presence 01 110 confessor for whom she had
0001. Ηο arrived too late, 00110001 that the servants had pillaged the palaee,
neglecting and even treating with indignity the lady’s corpse. See Histoire 1111000100,
