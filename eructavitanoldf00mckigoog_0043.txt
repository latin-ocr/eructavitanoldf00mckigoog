38 THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH 130EM. ’

humble,—this also appears in Augustine (Euchiridion, xxix), but
receives in Gregory the form which the poem reflecte. The spurious
commentos Gregory on Ι Kings vn: 13, 141 speaks of the fallen
angels as an order. This expression, taken with his well known
teachiug of the ninefold organisation of the angels, affords the poet
ground for his assertiou, which he bases on scripture, that there were
ten orders in the beginning. His further assertion, that nine angele,
one from each order, shall minister to each soul in the resurrection
of the just, I cannot refer to its source. Note the following
comparison of parts of the passages mentioned:

Gregory on I Kings, vu, 13, 14. 1797-1816·

Where Augustine and Gregory seem to firrnish the same material,
Ι regard the latter as the poet's master for the reasons that have been
advanced and for the following: The general trend of devout
thought was along paths trod by Gregory; he was a Benedictine; he
was held ,in especial reverence at St. Pierre-le-Vif, where his head

was cherished among the relics until 1628,² and his homilies appear ¹

to have been classed incur poet's time with the holy books appointed
for reading in the monastery.³
