40 THE ERUC'TA ΠΤ, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

expression in many medieval writers. A list of parallels is given
by Goldstaub-Wendriner,¹ which list, however, does not contain this
instance, nor that in the Physiolopcc of Hildebertus,² nor a briefer
one in Bartsch's Chrestortcthic Proverpclc, 335. At the time of our
poet the thought was already a commonplace, altho probably not yet

made· popular in the translations or adaptations of the Physiolopos
by Guillaume, Gervais and Pierre.³ The Latin¹ version of Origcn's
comment on Gen. XLIX, 9, in which reference is made to the
Phyciolopas, is probably the earliest of allusions to this thought which
had so great a fortune. But some materiale appear to be furnished
to the Christian imagination by one line of Vergil and by certain

credulous statements of Pliny.4 The Physiobpcc 'was generally ’
current among clerks and, directly or indirectly, must have prompted
the passage. But it may have been modified by Isidore's Etym. ΧΠ,
11, 5, since it states that the whelp, born dead, receives life, not (as
the Physiclopcc says) at his father s breathing upon his face but, as
Isidore says patria rapite ct fremitu tremefactus„ The writer of the
Eructavit is nowhere'a close imitator of his authorities yet he
reminds the reader of Philipps de Thaiin's Bacticire and 'Li Oampcz⁵
in using this modification (which is Origen's as well as Isidore's) and
also in his repeated use of the word cenatoriae in pointing the moral.⁶

There are traces in our poem of other devout compositions in the ·

vernacular.⁷ In the introduction‚ ll. 62-78, we find an allusion to
the descent of Christ into hell, which development of I Peter 111, 19,
isprobably due to the Gospel of Nicodemus. To the same work⁸
