THE ERUOTA vir, AN OLD FRENCH POEM. 11

claimed his right of lodgement at St. Pierre-le-Vif 3 butas this
there is no evidence.

Charter 326, however, is proof that Marie respected her deceased
husband's wishes.l She was seconded also in so doing by his brother, ·
the archbishop Guillaume of Reims. The¹ charter in question
promised to the Langres cathedral an annual gift of thirty liures, to
be taken from the fair of Bar-launo. The gift was in fulfilment of
a vow made by Henri while a prisoner in the hands of the Turks,
who had captured him as he returned from Palestine. He was
released by the influence of the Emperor of Constantinople.

Altho Count Henri I was by no means indifferent to literary
culture, he does not seem to have encouraged composition in the

' vernacular.² This honor, both by history and tradition, is awarded
. to his wife, the Countess Marie. Chretien de Troyes acknowledges
her encouragement and suggestions. Poeta less famous shared her ·
patronage or at least addressed their works to her.³

The year 1164 might at first thought seem to present the most
fitting occasion for offering to the countess what claims to be the
translation of an epithalamium, a chanaon de chambre, as it is called
in l. 2075. For in that year Marie became the wife of Henri I
. of Ohampagne. But there is no proof ,of this early date. The
absence of all allusion in the llractaat to this eminent crusader and
benefactor of the Ohurch argues that he was no longer alive when
the poem was made public.

There is perhaps some internal evidence for a much later date.
It is the passage, lh lero-1960, where David comforts the Church,
the Quaen of the allegory, for her children who had died as
martyrs. There would appear some fitness in a reference to the¹
. death of Marie's crusader son, Henri II, who was killed, probably

¹1bidaa, 109, 383.

²The direction of his literary interest is shown probably by the name, Scholastique,
given to one ol his daughters. She became the wile of Guillaume‚ count oi Maean.
Guiot ol Provins addresses him in song. This poet also (after a worldly life and a
brief experience of the Cisteroian order) was a Benedictine. See D'Arbois‚ Histoire,
