THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH POEM. 13

poet's conventional request for a reward. The generosity for which
the lady is complimented may well have increased 'her financial
straits They were to become more severe during her second
regency.1

-All the conditions, however, required by the dedication of a
devout poem to Marie of Champagne aud implied in the lines last
quoted seem to exist soon after the death of Count Henri Ι in ’
March, 1181. · ι

The most fitting occasion for presenting the poem to the widowed
countess in person occurred,I think, in 1185. For at the end of
that year,—in the Advent season, a fitting timefor the appearance
of a Christmas psalm, such as the poet claime (ll. 1511.) to have
made—she was at Sens, honorably received by King Philip
Augustus in a conference that included also her brothers-in-law,
Archbis'hop Guillaume of Reims, Oount Etienne of Sancerre, Count
Thibaut the Good of Blois, and their nephew, Hugues ΙΙΙ 01
Burgundy.² The conference was for the purpose of reconciling the
king with the powerful Ohampagne family which had long been in
,opposition, having taken the side of Philip of Flanders in his
quarrel with his former ward. ’ 011 Marie's side especially there
was much to forget; for the young king had married Elizabeth
of Hainaut, altho she had long been betrothed to Marie's son
Henri Π. But a reconciliation was effected. We may regard as one Ι
01 the incidents of this occasion the presentation of the Eructavit by
its writer to the Countess Marie. Yet the point is one that cannot
be proved absolutely. The probability of this earlier date, 1185,
seems to me the greater, altho it must be granted that no year
between 1181 aud 1198, the year of Marie’s death, can be fixed
upon with certainty.
Ἰ The poet’s character, his ¹mental furnishing and his purpose appear .

¹The financial demands made on Champagne 101 Henri II’s seven years (1190-
1197) in the Holy Land were doubtlese very great. Some of his debts (and his
mother’s, incurred in his behalf) were assumed by his brother, Thibaut 111. Henri
II had raised a great sum before his departure by the aide, an extraordinary levy
intended 101 such a crisis. See D’Arbois, Histoire, 1v, 70, 86, 97, V, charter 459.
