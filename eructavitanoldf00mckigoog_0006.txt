This paraphrase in verse of Psalm xnlv cf the Vulgate
(1010010011 cor meam* cabum bouum) must have enjoyed n0 small
popularity during three certunm, and in widely separated parts of
the then French speaking world. This is attested by the fourteen
copiesl that survive. Of these, two contain only· about a quarter
of the poem3 two, about one-half 3 while no less than ten are quite
complete or nearly so. '

In this study of the poem, aster an outline of the investigatione
⁰f. well known scholarS, are presented my conclusions upon its
contente and plan, the author's environment and character, his
materiale ’ ’

Conspiouous in the poem, and no doubt explaining much of its
popularity, are the passages at the beginning and end in which the
poet addresses his patroness A third address, containing only four
lines and serving merely as a transition passage without identifying

¹0ne 01 the fragments-Paris B. N. 902 (MS. L),—and eight 01 the complete
copies 01 the Eructavit-Paris, Ste. Genevieve, Lf. 13, (ns. 0); B. N. 2094 (MS. A);
1747 (MS. N ); 24429 (MS. G); Arsenah 3518, (MS. Η); Madrid, B. N. E. 150
(ns. B); Vatican, 1682 (MS. F); British Museum‚ add. 16606 (ms. E)‚-were copied
by me between December and August, 1891-’92 The other copies, exeepting that

01 Vienna, were at the same time rather hastily examined and compared. One 01 ‚
my copies, that made in the British Museum, was published in 1893, appearing with ,

abrief introduction in the Sciantific Balletia 01 Denison University‚ Granville, Ohio.
Ihave recently secured copies of the other nst: Paris, B. N. 1636 (Ms. K); 20046
(MS. Μ); 25532 (me. I); Arsenal, 3616 (Μο. J) and Vienna, Bibl. Palat, 3430
(Me. D).

The restored text 01 the Eructavit will be published by Professor Τ. Α. Jenkins,
01 the University 01 Chicago. As basis 01 the outline 01 the poem, or Part ΙΙ 01
this study, Ι have used my copy of the ns, in the Britis‘b Museum, published
in 1893, as stated above.
