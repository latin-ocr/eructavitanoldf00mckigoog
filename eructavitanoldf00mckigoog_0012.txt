THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH ΡΟΕΜ. 7 ’

Champagne, the Archbishop of 8000, Pope Alexander ΙΙΙ and
Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. The two great princes
of the church last named were exileS, being in controversy with
the two most powerful monarchs of their generation, Frederick·
Barbarossa and Henry II of England.

The Archbishop of 8000, whose suffragans were amongthe most
powerful prelates of northern France (four of them within the
dominions of the ¹house of Ohampagne), was atthis time Hugues
dc Toucy.¹ He had presided over the Council of Beaugency in ⁴
1152 01 which was pronounced tho sentence of divorce relcasing ·
Louis VII from his wife Eleanor. He ancinted this King²s second
and third queens, Constance in 1154, and Adela or Alix of Cham-
pagne in 1160. 'In 110 101100 year were found the remains of
88. Ρο1001100 and Altin,²—of 81. 80010100 100, says Gulielmus
Godellus,-byb the same energetic primate, 10 whom are attributed
five other 1000011000.3 ⁴

His successor in 1168 was Guillaume aux Blanches-Mains, a
shining example 01 110 high-born boy-bishup of the time,⁴ a younger
son of the house of Champagne,-splondidiaeimus juvenis domoon, as

Gulielmus Godellus calls him, in recording his election 101164 00
bishop of Chartres. Two years before, he had been chosen arch-

the property 01 81. Pierre-le7Vif. For in 1167 Henri Iof Champagne bought from
the monastery the bones 01 88. Ρο1001ἰο0 and Altin in return 1000001010 real estate
at'Provins and Naud. This sale was probably 001 known 10 110 public. Ihave 001

the pious count was collecting relies, has a local 00101 01 110 name Sabinian or
Savinian, so familiar at 8000.

At a later time· some 01 110 precious remains were claimed in yet another place.
' For in 1218 it required a formal inquest, conducted by Peter 01 0001011, Archbishop
