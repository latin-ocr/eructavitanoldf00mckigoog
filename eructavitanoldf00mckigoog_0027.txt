“You, who shall be both daughter and mother of God, lady high
and glorious,'' says he, “save virginity unimpaired. Nature obeys
God. An uncorrupted Man shall be born, the „Holy Spirit over-
shadowing.'' Ll. roal-1668.

The Holy Lady's adornmeuts

Omnis glorio ejus filice repra ab intua, in fimbria curma cir-
cumamicta nominibus.
’ This verse shows that the Holy Maid was exceeding fair. In her
beart, prized by the King above all else, are her ornaments. Good
thoughts, prompting good deeds, are her jewels. Ll. 1669-1694.
' Addncenlnr regi oirpines post eom: proximae ejus offerentur· riti.

Digressiorr: David's portrayal of judgment ; his warning against
pride (53 lines).——The King and Our Lady's glorious train (7
lines).—Digression: the poet's address to the patroness (4 lines).

Ll. 1695-1760.

The King and Queen attended with joy by augels and the

saved. The manner of the resurrection. The cause of the angels'
joy. The happiness of the saved and their crowns

Afferenlnr in laetitio et occultatione: adducentur in templum regia.

By a likeness that David narrates we can understand the great
joy that God gives to his own. In this world, when the crown is
to be assumed, the king and queen are escorted by lords and people
with rej0icing. Such joy as the queen then feels the saved shall
have in God's presence.

Say not tthat tIimagine it. For each soul shall have nine angels
to embrace and carry him about

On that thigh Saturday angels shall go forth seeking s,ouls
clothingt them 111 bodieS, bringing them withj Joy before God, whose
train shall thus be made full.

The angels will reJ oice because of God's workandpity: Helias
become of our racc and has welcomed usas brothers

The saved'shall not delay serving and honoring him. They shall
have crowns of different flowerS, each as he deserves Orowns of
precious stenes they shall have, causing the wearer,—uulike kings of

this world-no care, no war, no fear of death. Ll. 1761-1904.
