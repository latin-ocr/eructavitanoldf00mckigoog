Li uns fu sainz Saviniens, Par ces 11· fu France conquise :
Li autre sainz Potanciens. A 80111 111 10 premiere eglise

Qu'anbedui sorent mout et porent. Qu’ancor n’estoit il pas ocis
Des deciples Damede furent ; Quant cele eglise fu 10111100
Avec lui maugierent et burent. Qui de son non est honores.

Such a passage 00 that quoted above is usually thought to
determine the writer's home. It may be so taken here. Our
poet's general environment then was urbs antiquo Senonum, 1110
Canterbury of Franco. The abbey 01 81. Pierre-le-Vif was his
more particular environment. He was a Benedictine monk. The
reference 10 the monastery seems all the more decisivo 101 1110 reason ·
that the poet says nothing 01 the many other'religious foundations
in Sens, a city which 01 the time was probably unsurpassed in
France as an ecclesiastica] centre, being popularly called “little
Rome.''¹ For instance, he does not mention 1110 depository 01 81.
Loup's 101100, 1110 abbey 01 81. Columba. But he chooses 10 give the
names 01 the less conspicuous 81. Pierre-le-Vif and 110 traditional

founders 88. Savinian and Potentian.2 One reason for this choice ’

may be the desire 10 exalt especially the earliest heralds 01 1110
Gospel; but the stronger reason must be the local pride 01 1110 poet,
00 member of a community that held thern in special honor. The
proverb holds good here: Obeacuns precinas sea reliques 1000.
Accepting this theory, everything becomes 01 interest and import-
ance that concerns 80110 01111 1110 abbey 81. Pierre-le-Vif, as they
were in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Among the documents
