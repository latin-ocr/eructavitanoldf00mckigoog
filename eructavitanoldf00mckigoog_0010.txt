monasteries above mentioned. The chronicler of st. Columba is
anonymous; but two monks, known to us by name, Odorannus and
Clarius, separated by a century, wrote of St. Pierre-le·Vif. The
former recites at length the recovery, thru a dream of Queen
Constance, King Robert’s wife, in 1025,01 the precious relies,
hidden and forgotten at the time of the Norman invasion, genera-
tions before. In both chronicles abundant proof is afforded of the
reverence in which SS. Savinian and Potentian were held by the
· people of Sens and by the monks of St. Pierre-le-Vif. 'indeed the
monastery is sometimes called by the names of St. Peter and St.
Savinianl joined together. The chronicle of Clarius, who wrote
early in the twelsth century, has considerable interest for us. He
describes with unusual intelligence 'and enthusiasm several of the
chief ecclesiastical events of his own time, which he witnessed or
participated in. Yet he keeps himself in the background, barely
mentioning his own name in narrating what was probably his
proudest achievement: namely, his service as substitute for the
Abbot Amaldus and the Archbishop Daimbert on an occasion of
great moment for the community. After narrating the abbot's
efforts in defence of the monastery, endangered in its rights by
grasping neighbors, Clarius ends his chronicle by reciting his chief 's
labors for the library. This had been almost destroyed by fire in
1095, shortly before his election as abbot. He made it his task
to preserve and multiply the books of the monastery, and to devise
means for their preservation thenceforward. In order to more fully
render this important service he finally resigned his high position.
The collection due so largely to his efforts consisted, in the year
1123, of twenty volumes, a catalog of which the chronicle gives.
This loyal tribute of Clarius to his abbot, and the book-list, form
the conclusion.²
