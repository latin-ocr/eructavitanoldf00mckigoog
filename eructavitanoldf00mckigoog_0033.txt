28 THE ERUOTA Vlr, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

probably to render his composition more acceptable and authoritative.¹>
He is certainlya translator in many passages, and from the Latin
too. But his expressions about putting into Romanae the poem
written by David and used hy the Church on Christmas morning
mean· merely that his production is based on Psalm XLIV of the
Vulgate. It furnishes hima general theme and a series of texts,
which he treats according to the fanciful, allegorical style of his
patristic masters and of his own time.

The author of the Eructavit draws from many sources, some of
which I cannot identify. Probably much of his material is the
commonplace of medieval clerioal thought. Some of it is osten
found in several writers, who may have been accessible. We may
safely assume that there was some growth in the library of st.
Pierre·le-Vif in the fifty years that followed 1123. We may assume
also that occasionally in the scriptorium or cloister, the memory of a
follow-monh furnished a quotation or a thought which the poet was
able to use without consulting any boolr.

His manner 01 handlingmaterials borrowed from others is by no
means servile. Whether he deals with generally current thought or
something that clerks only know, the poet puts into it something of
his own. He at least chooses, arranges or expands in his own way.

Perhaps his use, ll. 140, 146 and 359, of the words cfcitier and
cycneicr, indicates sufficiently his method.²

¹Such a claim is very commonly made by Old French poets. For examplessee
lelrer (Zeitacttrijt s. rom. Ptiblogt'c, X, 485 ff.) on the word Romnacc.

Compare the words oi Chretien de Troyes at the beginning oi Gadtcnmc d’Aagletcrre
¹ and, more particularly, 01 Le chwclicrdelcchcrcttc. In the latter case, after crediting
Maris 01 Champagne with tc moriere ct tc acac, he promises, it would seem, to carefully
reirain from putting into his taslr anything but labor and thought:

Et il s’antremet
De panser si que rien n'i met
Fors sa painne et s'antancion.

Α So too the rather wide liberty exercised as translator by Petrarch, and defended by
him upon the authority 01 Horace, appears in his Latin version 01 Boccaccio's
Griceldc. See Robinson and Rolie's Pctrcrclt, pp. 191-193.
