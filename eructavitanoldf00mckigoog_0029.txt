24 THE ERUOYA VIr, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

Nearly all the complete copies of the Emcctovit (1100. A, I, N, E,
O, D, F, G) end with this added poem, which follows the address

to the patroness without any' apparent separation. It is lacking only

’ 111 MS. H and 111 1110 incomplete MSS. K, J, L and M. >The question
arises: Is it authentia 3 that is, did the author include it in his .

composition?

Unfavorable toi 110 authenticity are three circumstances which,
however, admit of explanation:

First, line 2080, 01 endroit ttsoo 111110 0011 may indicate, nottho
end of the entire composition, butonlythe end of'tsrts 1110111 portion,
the poet's alleged translation of David’s psalm. For his sense of
proportion leads him to end, as he had begun, with a brief statement,
ll. 2071-2100, 01 1110 purpose of his composition and with an address
to his patroness Irast of all he puts what is “in place of the

astho body of the poem, it ist there preceded by 01101 ther addition m

Third, the first line, Uoc dcccc protere 1 0, seems at first a

Favorable 10 110 authenticity are the following circumstances
which appear weightier, altho not perhaps decisivo.

as headings) would 000111 an attempt to conform this last part to the
