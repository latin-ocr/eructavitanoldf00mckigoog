44 THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD ERENCH POEM.

1287 ff, coo-658, 1722 ff.) in termox that suggest Eccli. x, 11 and
Sap. VI, 35 astho source.

The Gospels'are drawn upon about forty times, that of Luke most
frequently. Theannunciation and the virgin birth are dwelt on and
returned to with predileotion. Of the Epistles, that to the Hebrews
appears to serve the poet oftenest ; next is the First Epistle to
Peter3 while that to the Romans and that of James are used with
equal frequency, seven times each. The Apocalypse'about as osten
supplies the thought.

’ The Psalmo, without counting the one that serves, verse by verse,

. as the basis of the poem, are quoted oftener than any other Old
Testament book. This is not surprising in a poet who is at the same
time a Benedictine. The book of Proverbs may be put second 3 theri
Genesis3 next, with about equal frequency, Solomon's Song and the
apocryphal books, Ecclesiasticus and Sapientia. The apocryphal
chapter xlv of Daniel, Bel aad the Drcyoa, plainly influences the
· poet where the'Evangelist Mark and Daniel the prophet appear,
typifying the resurrection, in ll. ooo-972:

Quart il virent Saint Danidl Antre aus fu tote une semaine,
Si furent simple comme aignel : Qu’onques n’i ot ne mal ne paine.

” The poet shows the Bible an honor not given to the Fathers of
the Church, nor to the commentatore from whom I have shown that
he drawa. All these he leaves unmentioned. But four of the
bibli'cal writers, besides David who is always before uo, are named
when quoted: Moses Solomon, J eremiah, Paul. In ll.. 333-336,
Moses· commenda sincerity and well-doing. The reference is
probably to Dent. xxxl, 6-8. The lines in question are:

Mo'ysas nos dist et ansaingne A bien faire soient ¹tuit preu,
·Que nus el siegle ne se faingne: Qu’an i puet bien perdre son leu.

In treating the duty of an earthly ruler, ll. 1293-1308, he quotes
Solomon's counsel, probably referring to Sap. V13 2-6, 10, 22, 23.
He makes David (see p. 27) quote J eremiah's comfort to Israel, as
an erring wife. The reference is to J er. 111, 1 3 the lines are 1578-

1612, of which the first four are as follows: ,
