26 THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

In leaving this discussion 01 the poem's contents and plan we
must admit that the writer does not consistently adhere to his
purpose. This was, at the beginning, ll. 353-364, 10 represent
David as singing to the King and Quecn in turn nine verses each.

He had the same Latin text 01 the Psalm‚ it seemS, that the
printed copies 01 thc Vulgate have contained since 1592. The
division into verses was practically the same. The first verse, altho
expounded at length by Angustine and other commentatore, our
writer leaves untouched, recognizing probably that it is merely a
title. From the two halves 01 the second verse he gets the headings
for his introduction, separating it into two parts. Then by dividing ¹
verses 3 and 8 he is able to command the· required number 01 verses
10 serve as headings 1011116 body 01 his poem. The verses are
sometimes distributed in phrases 01 clauses. In two cases more than
one verse is used as a heading We may grant that he has fulfilled
the purpose announced 10 use Dc chosach ,10 vcra 61111011, employing
rather sreely, with a poet's license perhaps, bis terms and his texts.

But the other part 01 his plan, direct address by David, he is far
from carrying out. He neglects it in about 11011 01 the poem, and
apparently contents himself with addressing the reader. In 0116
passage 01 transition, ll. ivea-1752, he addresses 010 dame, the
patroness. Probably, however, it is the poet's shill that leads him
10 avoid direct address in the long passages about the King's arrows, '
11. cca-868, and throne, ll. acc-1154. Apostrophes 01 such length
would be difficult to manage.

At several points the poet indulges ina digression, as my outline
shows, In other places, toward the close, he introduces material
that seems irrelevant. But he thus rounds out a'mmposition which
like many produced 01 that period, is not distinguished 101 organic
unity. On the other hand one omission on his part must be noted.
He fails to comment 011 one phrase 01 verse 9, c domibus eburneio,¹

1Τ1161106101011111610 comment on this phrase indicates, I think, that 116 had not
within reach Jerome’s exposition ol Ps. xmv, (which is also addressed 10 a lady),
Epistola LX Vod Principium. For here the comment is so in 1116 11116 01 our poet’s
v quaint fancy that 116 would almost certainly have used it, if it had been known 10111111.
Jerome says:
