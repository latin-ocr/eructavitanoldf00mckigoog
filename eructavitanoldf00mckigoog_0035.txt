even in minute details the animated introduction of the poem, ll. 21-
204, 205-366. The extracta, in the arrangement of which Ihave
taken some liberty with the order, show the spirit and formos this
introduction fairly well. Here as elsewhere, the poet uses borrowed
material with freedom: much of it he puts into a dialog3 he uses the
device of a vision; he makes David the prophet and singer of the
marriage. In the latter point, which is insisted on from beginning
to end of the Ενιιοίαυὶί,1 he is like Radbertus Paschasius²

It may be said that the poet's method of collecting material is ι

eclectio-il prend coa biert ort it le trouva-also that he is original
rather thau servile in employing it. Further, he seldom notities the
reader when the thought is borrowed and almost never gives credit by
name. The lew exceptione to this rule have to do with the Bible,

and will be treated farther on. The poet's own personality is kept '

out of sight: he is anonymouS, almost impersonal. Hc makes his
authorities share in the same studied reserve. Let us grant, however,
that, altho his influence might be increased by the great names which
complete frankness would have led him to mention, his art has done
well to keep them back. They are indeed too numerous to mention.

His pages would bristle with names; for his poem, like the Roman
de Ia Itone,3 draws from many different writers

Let me now show where the poet appears indebted to the great
Fathers of the Church, Augustine and Gregory the Great. Both

¹At the very close, ll. 2071-2076, just before the final address to the patroness, the
poet takes leave of lris work:

ci androit faut Eructavit, Le fondemant de nostre foi.
Li bitus saumas le roi David, Chaucon de chambre l'apela,
Ou Damedes nos mostre au doi Einsi com Deus li revela.

As early in the poem as l. 82, David is introduced aethe divinely inspired author
of what our poet presente in translation t

Ceste cbanpon que j'ai escrite
Trova il par saint asperite.

accepted (Romania, xxr, 435), altho on pp. 21, 23 he seems in error conceming the
husband of Marie ol champagne.
