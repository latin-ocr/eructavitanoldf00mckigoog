34 ΤΗΕ ERUOTAVIT, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

have furnished him almost the same material in comments upon Ps.
VH, 13; LXXVI, 19, found in the. Moralio ia Job, XIX, and referred
to above. In the latter case Paterius has not quoted the passage in
full. In both cases the arrows are interpreted as representing, not
the preaohers‚ but their messages
Two other commento, enforced by this figure and not found in
Patentis, are those of Macalla ia rob, vn and ΧΧΧΝ.ι The former,
quoting Is. LXVI, 19 (ud peotes ia more, iu Africum, et io Lydiam
...ia Italiam, ia Graeciam) implies the going forth of messengers
as well as their words. It may have prompted in the poet's mind
the idea of the apostolic “ spheres of influence‚'' whioh he carries out
with so much detail, ll. 7 50-826, following in general the tradition
recorded by Isidore, De ortu ot obitu potrum, 133.

The¹ poet shows some originality anda medieval thoroughness in
allegorizing, in explaining the feather on the arrow, which neither of
his masters had mentioned. The following are the lines', 720-7aa:

Et la pane qui les conwoie,

Sainz Esperites qui les maine,
Qui lor done force et alaine.

¹Upon verse 7 of the Psalm‚ that is upon the King's throne and
scepter, the poet gives us nearly three hundred lines. Most of this
long passage deals wit-h the four great propheta each attended by a
beast at one of the four feet of the throne. The beasts symbolice the

Evangelists. Here Gregory furnishes much material, a little of -

which suffices the poet. The beasts or living forms are not assigned
according to Augustine, Iu Jooaais Euangeliou, vectatus xxxvr,
5,² the lion for Matthew and the man's likeness for Mark; but
according to Gregory's Fourth Homily on Ezekiel: the man's
liheness for Matthew‚ the lion for Mada, the ox for Luhe and for
John the eagle‚—the symbols used by Jerome also, Expositio Quotam·
Eooapcliorum‚ Prologus.

¹See Migne, nxxv, 769 and nxxvr, 728.
