10 THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

Vif had enjoyed, we know not how long, an important commercial
privilege (u poids). They were the official weighers. This privilege
was confirmed to the monastery in 1174 by Henri I in a charter still
extant.l ·

In the war between Queen Constante and her son, Henri Ι, in
1031, one half of the town Sens was given to Eudes I of Cham-pagne.

betrothed to the house of Hainaut. His return from Palestine
occurred in the spring of 1181. He stopped on the way at Sena,
where he met the young king Philip Augustus, and died at Troyes,
