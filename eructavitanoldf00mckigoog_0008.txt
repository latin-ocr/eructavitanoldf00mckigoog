THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENOH POEM. 3

The only expressions that serve here to identify the patroness are
rao 010110 de Ohompoipae, l. 3, and 10 100111 0001 10 101 de Froaee,
1. 2108. These, taken together, ean refer only to Marie, daughter
¹ of King Louis VII and Quaen Eleanor. She became 0000100001
Champagne in 1164, upon her marriage with Henri Ι, 110 Liberal,
, astera betrothal beginning in early ohildhood. On the death 01 101
father and the aooession 01 101 1011-1101101, Philip Augustus, in
1181, she could 10 spoken 01 00 “sistier of 110 King 01 Franoe.'’
In the same year she became a widow, and her bereavement, it 10
thought, offered to the devout poet his opportunity.

Alter being forgotten for three oenturies, the Eructavit began
about two generations ago 10 0111001 some attention from studente
of the life, thought and speeoh 01 medieval Franoe. Certain well
known investigators have made some expression in print concerning
it, as one 01 110 many 1001110 worthy 01 study.l ·

Prosper Tarbe deserves the eredit 01 pointing out Sens as the
authors oity, and the Benedictine abbey, St. Pierre-le-Vif, as his
home. This appears from the following passage, ll. 769-786,
where the local saints of Sens are mentioned by name :-

Li bons arohiers qui si loing 10000 Qui s’aresturent droit a Sana
Retraist ·ii· saietes an Franee, La estoit lors toz li bofois
Bien legieres 01 1100 tranohanz, Et li 01100 00 Sarazinois.

Opinione coneerning the identity of the dome de Otompoipae varied even aiter 1865,
when the fourth volume oi D’Arbois de Jubainville’s work, mentioned above,
appeared. The statement 01 P: Meyer, Rorroniu, vr, 9, leot-note, sets the matter at
rest. To G. Paris is due the assignment of the year 1181 as the earliest probable
date ol the poem. ·
