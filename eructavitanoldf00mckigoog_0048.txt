THE ERUOTA VII, AN OLD FRENCH POEM. 43

Vos creature vos atandent ; Mout vos desinent et demandent
Mout vos soeident et demandent.” Qu’anperedr vos vueleut feire.'’

In spite of the much smaller scale of his work, and the difference in
subject and vocabulary, our poet shows a strong resemblance in style
and rhetorio to Chretien. In the simpler rhetorical devices they have
much in common. For instance, in the use of enumeratione, of
alliteration, of synonyme, one sees attempted in the dhactooit what
Chretien's werke employ in such abundance.l '

In conclusion I return to the Bible as, nevertheless, the poet’s
chief source of material. Those texts which the poet seems to have
taken in the form employed by the Fathers of the Church, especially
by Augustine and Gregory the Great, have been already pointed out.
But it may be said that the whole poem is biblical in tone, aud even
in thought and words. Numerous instances of quotation or allusion
can be pointed out, some of them referring repeatedly to the same
text.

Those directly referred to their authors by the poet ‚are few, as will
be shown. But there are more thana hundred instanoes in which
biblical thought is used. Sometimes the very words are used iu an
unmistakable way. Note the following: Fora hortorum, puteus
aquarum viventum, Cant. Iv, 15, seems to be reproduoed in l. 2019 :
Sachiez que c'est fontaiaac et paim and Ps. XXXIII, 11, Inquirentca
autem Dominum non minuentur omni bono, may be recognized in ll. Ι

2033, 2034:

Qui Deu aime et de lui anquirat, .
Seiirs soit il que miez l'an iert.

Sometimes altho the decisive words are repeated, the thought is
widely divergeut, or has become highly figurative.
Certain texts, one should perhaps say certain themes, are favorites

with the poet. Thus his expressions upon heaveuly joy as superior

to that of earth or surpassiug thought (ll. 220-224,--1565-1570,
2065-2070) appear to be framed with the help of I Cor. II, 9 and
Is, LXIV, 4. He warns against pride and the abuse of power (ll.
