THE ERUOTA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH POEM. . 25

three classes into which, as Professor T. A. J enhins informs me, the
use. fall. BesideS, the lauguage shows general agreement with that
of the main poem.

Finally, the poet's wordS, ll. aior-2102, ‚

Une douce proiere i a
Qui cst an leu de Gloria,

Ι show that it is used with a purpose: it is to serve as the Gloria
ψ after the psalm. The strength of his purpose appears in the
miraculous incident serving as transiticn,1 and renders him insensible
even to the anachronism of ascribing to the prophet Isaiah a prayer
that is iu the Christian form.

I suggest therefore that not only the transiticn passage, ll. 2101-
2130 (the story cf Isaiah’s thirst miraculcusly quenched and the
recommendation of the prayer as efficacicus), hut also the prayer cr ·
, doxology that follows, ll. 2131-2168, should be considered at least
as included by compilation or adaptaticn in cur poet's productiori,
perhaps even as original with him.²

¹The reader may judge of 'rhis by seeing the passage itself‚ ll. arm-2120, which is
here quoted τ

Une douce proierei a· . Quant li soierre s'arestoit

Qui est en leu de Gloria, Prist le prophete une grana sois ;
Siestestraited’Ysayc, Mes por ce que li cuiverz rois μ
Qui apela Deu en aie Ne soffri qu'an li donast boivre,
Quant li crues rois Manassis Deu ccmanpa a remantcivre.
Qui par linage estoit ses aies Par cez paroles le prcia

Le traist de Iherusalem fors Et Damedes li anvcia

si le scia parmi le cors. Un fil d'iaue devera le ciel,

Por le tormant qui graiudre fust Soef et douce come miel.

La sie fist faire de fuet. Ι ,Si ,tot come il l’ot avalee ¹
En cel angoisse ou il estoit, Si eu fu l’ame a Deu alce.

This is immediately followed bya recommendation ol the prayer, as still efficachus,
-“ whoever cn' Friday mornings says it in Romanae cr in Latin, is never overtaken
hy sin‚”-and then begins the prayer, Marci de moi, etc.

¹In his brief notice of the Madrid ms, Balictia dc io Sociale des ccciccc Teates
franceis, 1878, 50, P. Meyer quotes two passages of the Eructavit, the second of

which is fron this added poem.
