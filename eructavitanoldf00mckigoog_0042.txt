The longer connected passages have beon referred to their most
probable sources The credit is divided between the two great
Fathers of the Church, Augustino and Gregory the Great. In most
instances we note that the ideas first uttered by the former were
afterwards given hythe latter the form and scope in which they
became generally current. This is true of the two important
passages that I shall discuss next.

The digression on pride, ll. 1695-1748, is based on Ecoli. X, 15,
'Initium omnia peccati cst auperbio. , Augustino (Io Epistulam Joaaao,
lloctotocvrr, 23 Vin, 6, 9 ; Ia Jooaat'c mapparum, tractatus XXV,
15, 16, and elsewhere) urges the lesson. Quemcumque caim diobolae

superbum feccrit, vincit, he says, and Caput omnium morborum ,

superbia eat-quio capot omnium peccatorum coopertio. But Gregory
(Homil. XXXIV in Eooop. and Morul. XXXIV) enlarges upon the
samo text: he expounds and expands it with the details which the
poet uses to a considerable extent. The latter's enumeration of sins
is not so complete as that of Gregory, yet he says:

D'orguel vienent maint mauvais Et maint pechio que nuls ne cuide.

He seems to add a touch of his own, probably a lurid reminiscence
of some contemporary liturgica] drama, in the concluding linea,
ν 1738-1741, of the digression on pride:

Li orguilleus, tuit eslaissie, Et li deable apres bruiant,
S'an torneront aval fuiant, Tuit livre an peinne vantoire.

The poet's teaching about the lost angels, ll. 179321830, who fell
by pride and whose loss is repaired by elect men, believing and

¹The poet's own experience may be sarving him here: he is employiug perhaps a
reminiscence of the Pope upon the cedia gestatoria, having seen Alexander III thus '
borne in state while sojourning at Sena .
