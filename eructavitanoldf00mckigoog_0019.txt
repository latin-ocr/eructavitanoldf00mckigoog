14 THE EBUC'TA VIT, AN OLD FRENCH POEM.

quite plainly in his production. His expression is labored and trite
at times, but he always utters devout thought and usually in bib·
lical terms. The selection 01 1 psalm as a theme is not surprising
in a Benedictine. The Eructavit is in general such apoem as one
would expect from a monk possessing some literary skill and
ambition with a desire to edify and admonish. He is not servile in
his manner 01 addresS, but rather magnifies his office as interpreter
of divine things He turns, as he alleges, a Latin original into the
vernacular Ι11111 11 may be completely understood, “unless folly
deceive.'' His work is to arrange it and turn it into rime:

Ll. 15-20. Ll. 139-144.

Le 101 (10 N 011 au matin De latin 11 an romanz traite

Nos dist sainte eglise an latin Au miauz qu'il puet cil qui l’afaite.
Le saume que 10 vos comana ; Oiant toz bons clers, dist il bien
Metre le'vcs vuel an romana, Qu'il n'i a antrepris de rien

Si porroiz prandre que que soit, Fors la androit ou rime faut,

’ 80 folia ne vos deccit. 81 met le mot qui autant vaut.

This would imply that the lady needs a translator, and the following
passages that she is to hear rather than read for herself :

Ll. 1749, 1750. Ll. 1687, 1888.

cist vers apres 001110 11 1010, Qui bien 011011 01 antandroit
S'est bien droiz que ma dame l'oie. Qua cist vers conte ci androit . . .

The writer conforme to the literary conventions of his time. The
beginning of the poem especially, 11. 7-14, is after the manner of a
minstrel addressing a patron, and hints, as already shown, that
remuneration is expected. He even attributes to David, joculator
Dei, at heaven’s gate, a similar request in ll. 235-238: ¹

Juglerre sui, sagos 01 duiz ; (le sai je bien que les sodees
80 10 101 plaisoit mes deduiz, Me seroient mout granz donees.

He employs a current 'literary fiction also in claiming to be merely
atranslator, as Ι shall try 10 show. Another characteristic of
medieval 01011011 literature is the vision, such as David begins at 1.
